Password Cracking Attempts

This Python script is designed for educational purposes to simulate password attempts and study password security. It generates random combinations of characters to check the strength of passwords and understand the concept of brute-force attacks. It is important to note that using such techniques on real systems without proper authorization is strictly prohibited and against ethical guidelines.

Always ensure that your coding practices align with ethical standards and adhere to any relevant laws or policies. If you have any questions about ethical coding or need assistance with a different programming topic, feel free to ask!
